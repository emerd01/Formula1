        <h1>Formula 1</h1>
        <p>Back in January of 2019, I was browsing through Netflix and came across this series called <i>Drive to Survive</i>. In this show, which was produced by Netflix, the viewer was able to get an behind the scenes, raw version of the sport. Prior to seeing this show, I had heard of Formula 1 but had never watched it. Since then, I have become an avid watcher of the sport because of its combination of things I enjoy: Cars, cinematography, and data. In recent years, data has had an increasingly important role around the world in understanding things, but it takes someone understanding the data to make it meaningful. Like Dr. B points out on his website, "If you can't access data...you effectively don't have data." There is a lot of data involved with Formula 1, so I have set myself up for quite the challenge with this project. However, I'm up for the challenge and looking forward to creating a better understanding for the sport for myself.</p>
        <p>As I've come to enjoy the sport, deciding which team to root for has always been interesting. As of right now, Mercedes is a team that consistently wins nearly every weekend and is honestly a bit boring to watch. Instead, watching what is called "the mid-field" is far more exciting because that is where the real racing takes place. One team who has recently been in hot water is called Racing Point, and other teams have protested that the team more or less copied the design of the 2019 Mercedes car. As a result, the 2020 Racing Point cars have been outpacing many of the other teams' 2020 cars. In essense, a 2019 car made by Mercedes is so fast that it can outpace most 2020 cars. Certainly, funding and sharing designs have impacted the outcomes of races in recent years, so I want to look into which teams have been doing well over time, and how regulations and funding have impacted performance and points.</p>
