        <h2>General Overview</h2>
        <p>Formula 1 has had races taking place from the 1950s through today. However, as I was examining my graphs for both driver points and constuctor points since the 1950s, I found that a pattern arose: Around the year 2010, a huge spike in points for the teams and drivers placing in the top positions took place. When I looked further, I found that the cause for this taking place had to do with a change in how the points were distributed. Rather than following a generally linear progression of distribution, the FIA (the International Automobile Federation) decided to follow an exponentially decreasing progress. Currently, the driver that comes in first is awarded 25 points, followed by 18 points in 2nd and 15 points in 3rd, and so on. This increased separation of points in the top scoring teams and drivers makes it so teams that are already doing poorly continue to do so while the top teams and drivers rake in more points and dollars than ever. Further, this divide in the sport decreases competativeness between the 10 teams and instead segments them into 3 separate "tiers." In so doing, Formula 1 does what is often an issue in America: Make the rich richer and make the poor poorer.</p>
        <h2>What The Graphs Show</h2>
        <p>In 2010, a major change in Formula 1 took place: A complete reorganization of point distribution. The first graph emphasizes the spike that took place, which was prevelant in my dashboard, further separating and segmenting the teams from one another. The second graph highlights just how big of an impact this has on the distance from first to tenth place. Previously, the scoring followed a relatively linear distribution of points, and the points now are distributed more on an exponential curve. These graphs help to show just how much this separation means for Formula 1 as a whole.</p>
        <h2>Solution to the Problem</h2>
        <p>Simply put, I would urge a return to the old system of point distribution. For the past ten years, the points have been distributed on an exponential curve instead of one that is more linear. In order to foster new teams and drivers, I would encourage the FIA to reconsider a more even distribution of the points. In so doing, I believe the sport would return to its more competative nature and enhance the expiernce for drivers and viewers alike.</p>
